## Features

## Getting Started

Make sure you have [DevKitA64](https://devkitpro.org/) installed. Installations can be found on their website.
For Unix-like platforms, it is recommended to use [Pacman](https://github.com/devkitPro/pacman) for installing the
required tools.

### Running the app

Run `make` inside this folder. Put the `.nro` file you just created on your SD card and launch it.
